# Tic Tac Toe with AI

This is my completed Tic Tac Toe with AI project from the JetBrains Hyperskill Java For Beginners learning track. 

This project had a huge learning curve with learning about and implementing recursion, but after a week or two of trial and error, I was finally able to wrap my head around it, pass all of the tests, and complete the project.

This game has the option for a user to play a computer, two users to play each other, or the choice for the user to watch two ai's  play each other. There are three levels of ai difficulty to choose from (easy, medium and hard), though I wouldn't spend too long trying to beat the hard ai as it was built using the minimax algorithm and literally cannot be beaten. I encourage you to try it for yourself!

As with all of my completed projects in Hyperskill, all commits for the project progress are in the general java repo I use for all practice exercises/projects.
