# Tic Tac Toe with AI

This is my completed Tic Tac Toe with AI project from the JetBrains Hyperskill Java For Beginners learning track.

This project had a huge learning curve with learning about and implementing recursion, but after a week or two of trial and error, I was finally able to wrap my head around it, pass all of the tests, and complete the project.

## About

This game has the option for a user to play a computer, two users to play each other, or the choice for the user to watch two ai's  play each other. There are three levels of ai difficulty to choose from (easy, medium and hard), though I wouldn't spend too long trying to beat the hard ai as it was built using the minimax algorithm and literally cannot be beaten. I encourage you to try it for yourself!

## Instructions

To begin, simply type 3 commands separated by spaces:

First command is always "start."
Second command is either "user" for a human player, OR the level of ai difficulty you want to play.
Third command is either "user" for a human player, OR the level of ai difficulty you want to play (same as second command, order only depends on who you want to go first).

Example #1: start user user - *two users playing each other*
Example #2: start user easy - *a user (player 1) playing an easy level ai (player two)*
Example #3: start medium user - *a medium level ai (player 1) playing a user (player 2)*
Example #4: start hard hard - *two hard level ai's playing each other*

To end, simply type "exit"

## Additional Info

As with all of my completed projects in Hyperskill, all commits for the project progress are in the general java repo I use for all practice exercises/projects.
